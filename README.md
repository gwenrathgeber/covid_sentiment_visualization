## Problem Statement

The COVID-19 response has been largely regional and state-based in nature. Some states have enacted strictly enforced stay-at-home policies, while others have provided guidelines. It would be worthwhile to compare the sentiment analysis of social media posts across geographic regions and compare them to both the local policies on social distancing and the occurrences of the pandemic in those areas.
